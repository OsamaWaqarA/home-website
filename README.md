# Personal Web Application (Python + Flask)

This is a personal web application I built to replace third-party services like Google Drive, online password managers, and file hosting tools.  
The application is designed for local use (it runs only inside my home network) to keep my data and my family’s data private.  

⚠️ Note: Many files and details have been redacted in this repository for privacy and security reasons.

## Features
- Secure file storage and retrieval (personal Google Drive alternative)  
- Password and sensitive data management (local password manager)  
- Web-based interface powered by Flask  
- Database-backed storage using MySQL (dbms.py)  
- Dynamic pages with JavaScript for interactivity  
- Runs only within the local network for maximum privacy  
- Modular design for future extension

## Technologies Used
- Python (core backend logic)  
- Flask (web framework)  
- MySQL (database for files, users, and records)  
- JavaScript (frontend interactivity)  
- HTML/CSS (templates and styling)  

---

## How It Works
1. The Flask app (app.py) provides routes for uploading, downloading, and managing files.  
2. Database operations (user records, file info, password storage) are handled by dbms.py and MySQL.  
3. JavaScript enhances frontend usability (dynamic forms, UI improvements).  
4. Passwords and sensitive data are stored locally, never exposed outside the network.

## Project Structure (Redacted for Privacy)
- app.py → Main Flask application (routes, server startup)  
- dbms.py → Database handler for MySQL (queries, data storage)  
- templates/ → HTML templates (redacted)  
- static/ → Static assets like CSS/JS (redacted)  
- data/ → Storage for files and records (not included)

## Note
This project is not my most advanced work, but it demonstrates my ability to:  
- Build full-stack applications (Python + Flask + MySQL + JS)  
- Apply DBMS knowledge with MySQL integration  
- Implement a practical local system that replaces commercial services  
- Focus on privacy, security, and usability  

Due to the personal nature of this application, the full codebase is not shared. Only partial/demo code is provided here.
